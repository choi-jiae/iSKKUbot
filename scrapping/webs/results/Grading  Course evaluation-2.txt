Grading Policy

Attendance, exams (midterm, final, and unscheduled), presentations, assignments, behavior in class, etc. will be taken account when grading.
When grading, the lecturer decides the ratio of each element (attendance and so on); it is not determined by the Universityâ€™s policies.
Absence of more than 3 out of 16 weeks will result in the failure of a particular course.
