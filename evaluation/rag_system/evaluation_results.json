    "generated_answer": " At Sungkyunkwan University, the formula used to calculate GPA (Grade Point Average) for both undergraduate and graduate students is as follows:\n\nGPA = (Total number of credits earned * Total grade points earned) / Total number of credits attempted\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. Calculate the grade points earned for each course by multiplying the grade obtained in that course by the corresponding credit hours. For example, if you received an A+ (4.5) in a 3-credit course, your grade points would be 13.5 (4.5 x 3).\n2. Add up all the grade points earned for each course.\n3. Calculate the total number of credits attempted by adding up all the credit hours taken across all courses.\n4. Divide the total grade points earned by the total number of credits attempted to get your GPA.\n\nFor example, if you have completed 12 credits with a grade distribution as follows:\n- A+ (4.5) in a 3-credit course = 13.5 grade points\n- B+ (3.5) in a 4-credit course = 14 grade points\n- C (2.0) in a 2-credit course = 4 grade points\n\nYour total grade points would be: 13.5 + 14 + 4 = 31.5\nYour total credits attempted would be: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9 credits\nSo, your GPA at Sungkyunkwan University would be: 31.5 / 9 = 3.5\n\n\n sources: \n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf",

    "generated_answer": " Yes, students at Sungkyunkwan University can choose between their original grade and the grade from retaking a course. This is known as \"grade replacement\" or \"course repetition.\" If a student receives an unsatisfactory grade in a course, they have the option to retake the course and replace the original grade with the new one. However, there are certain conditions and limitations that apply to this policy.\n\nFirstly, students can only repeat courses once. They cannot repeatedly take the same course to improve their grade. Secondly, the replacement of a grade is subject to specific requirements set by the university. For example, the student must have completed the course with a higher grade than the original one. Additionally, there may be restrictions on how many times a student can use this option in a given semester or academic year.\n\nTo request a grade replacement, students need to submit an application form to the relevant department or office. The university will then review the request and make a decision based on the student's academic performance and other relevant factors. If approved, the original grade will be replaced with the new one, and the student's overall GPA will be recalculated accordingly.\n\nIt is important to note that grade replacement may not always result in an improvement of the student's GPA. In some cases, the new grade may be lower than the original one, which could negatively impact the student's academic standing. Therefore, students should carefully consider their options and consult with their academic advisors before deciding whether to request a grade replacement.\n\nIn summary, Sungkyunkwan University allows students to choose between their original grade and the grade from retaking a course through the grade replacement policy. However, there are certain conditions and limitations that apply, and students should carefully consider their options before making a decision.\n\n\n sources: \n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf",

    "generated_answer": " In South Korea, there are certain restrictions placed on individuals who have unpaid contributions to their national health insurance system. These restrictions aim to encourage timely payment of insurance premiums and ensure that the healthcare system remains financially stable. Here are some key points regarding the restrictions for those with unpaid contributions:\n\n1. Limited access to medical services: Individuals with unpaid contributions may face limitations in accessing certain medical services, such as hospitalization or surgery. They might be required to pay a higher out-of-pocket expense or receive lower priority for treatment compared to those who have paid their insurance premiums on time.\n2. Penalties and interest charges: Unpaid contributions are subject to penalties and interest charges, which can accumulate over time. These penalties aim to discourage individuals from delaying payment and encourage them to settle their outstanding debts promptly.\n3. Suspension of insurance coverage: In severe cases, the national health insurance system may suspend an individual's insurance coverage if they have consistently failed to pay their contributions for a significant period. This suspension can result in the loss of healthcare benefits until the outstanding debts are settled.\n4. Collection efforts and legal actions: The national health insurance system may take collection efforts, such as sending payment reminders or initiating legal actions, to recover unpaid contributions. These measures aim to ensure that individuals fulfill their financial obligations towards the healthcare system.\n5. Reinstatement of coverage: Once an individual has settled their outstanding debts and paid all penalties and interest charges, they can reinstate their insurance coverage. However, they may face a waiting period before their coverage is fully restored, during which time they may still be subject to certain restrictions or limitations in accessing medical services.\n\nIt is essential for individuals to understand the importance of timely payment of national health insurance contributions and comply with the rules and regulations set by the healthcare system. Failure to do so can result in various restrictions and penalties, which can negatively impact their access to necessary medical care.\n\n\n sources: \n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf",

Grading plays a crucial role in determining students' eligibility for various programs, scholarships, and other opportunities within the university.\n\nAt SKKU, there are several types of grading systems:\n\n1. Undergraduate Grading System: This system is used to evaluate students' performance during their undergraduate studies. Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 1.75 or above to avoid academic probation and potential dismissal. If a student fails to meet the required GPA, they may be subject to mandatory grade retention, which means that their grades for that semester will be invalidated.\n2. Graduate School Grading System: This system is used to evaluate students' performance during their graduate studies. Students must fulfill all the requirements, including passing the dissertation submission qualifying exam and successfully defending their thesis. Additionally, students who are admitted based on proof of English proficiency must satisfy the minimum requirement for Korean language ability before graduation.\n3. Combined Master and Ph.D. Program Grading System: This system is used to evaluate students' performance during their combined master and doctoral studies. Students must fulfill all the requirements, including passing the dissertation submission qualifying exam and successfully defending their thesis. Additionally, they must complete a certain number of credits and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 or above.\n4. Academic Probation and Mandatory Grade Retention: If a student fails to meet the required academic standards, they may be subject to academic probation or mandatory grade retention. This can lead to dismissal from the university if not addressed properly.\n5. GLS (Graduation and Leave of Absence System): The GLS system helps students manage their academic affairs more easily. It provides information on academic calendars, applications/graduations, academic status/personal information, courses, study areas, IT services, and electronic voting. Students can bookmark menu items for convenience.\n\nIn summary, grading at Sungkyunkwan University is essential for evaluating students' performance, ensuring they meet the necessary requirements for graduation, and providing them with opportunities to succeed academically. The various grading systems in place help maintain academic standards and ensure that students are prepared for their future careers or further studies.\n\n\n sources: \n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf",

    "generated_answer": " At Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), students must apply for specific majors using the General Ledger System (GLS) during the designated application period. To do this, they need to set rankings for all major preferences based on their own interests and academic goals. The order of students' GPAs will determine their assigned majors.\n\nFor international students who entered SKKU through regular admission, there is a limit of 50% of the total number of students admitted via this track that can enter each major. This means that if you are an international student, it is essential to apply for your preferred major during the application period and rank them accordingly.\n\nAfter the application period ends, students cannot modify their application details. To change their preferences or apply for a new major, they must do so during the changing period. If they did not apply during the initial application period, they can still apply within this time frame.\n\nTo submit an application, students should go to GLS > Academic Status/Personal Area > Major Application. They will need to provide their Korean language proficiency certificate (TOEIC or Sungkyunkwan Language Institute Level 4 or above) before entering the second academic year if they are international students who entered after 2016.\n\nFor students with foreign nationality who hold TOEIC level 6 and have an average GPA of 3.5 or higher, they can apply for priority assignment of their desired departments during a separate application period. If you are admitted as a specific major, you must submit your Korean language proficiency certificate (TOEIC Level 4 or above) by December 30th/June 30th to be eligible to register for your major subjects.\n\nIt is important to note that there are limitations on applying for multiple majors and maximum applicable credits for international students who entered SKKU through special admission after 2016. They must submit a Korean proficiency certificate by the end of their third semester, or they will be restricted from applying for additional majors and have limited access to certain courses.\n\nFor graduate students pursuing natural sciences, there are various facilities available on campus, including engineering labs, research complexes, and dormitories. The university also has a gymnasium complex, student center, and other recreational facilities.\n\nIn summary, to rank your preferred majors at Sungkyunkwan University, you should carefully consider your interests and academic goals and apply for them during the designated application period.

Generally, readmitted students must meet certain academic and disciplinary standards to be allowed to continue their studies. These requirements may include:\n\n1. Academic Standards: Readmitted students must maintain a minimum GPA (Grade Point Average) or academic standing that is satisfactory according to the university's guidelines. This may vary depending on the student's program and the reasons for their dismissal.\n2. Disciplinary Standards: Students who were dismissed due to disciplinary issues, such as violations of the university's code of conduct or academic integrity policies, may be required to complete additional disciplinary requirements before they can be readmitted. This could include attending workshops, counseling sessions, or completing a probationary period.\n3. Course Requirements: Depending on the reasons for their dismissal, readmitted students may be required to retake certain courses or make up missed credits. They may also need to complete additional coursework or examinations to demonstrate their understanding of the material.\n4. Time Limit: Some universities have a time limit for readmission, meaning that students who were dismissed must apply for readmission within a specific period after their dismissal. If they do not apply within this time frame, they may need to reapply as new applicants and meet the university's current admission requirements.\n5. Financial Obligations: Students who owe financial obligations to the university, such as tuition or fees, must resolve these issues before they can be readmitted. This may involve making payments or entering into a payment plan with the university.\n6. Health and Wellness Requirements: In some cases, students may need to provide documentation from a healthcare professional verifying their fitness to return to campus and participate in academic activities.\n7. Re-entry Seminars or Workshops: Some universities require readmitted students to attend re-entry seminars or workshops designed to help them transition back into the academic environment and address any challenges they may have faced during their dismissal period.\n8. Probationary Period: Readmitted students may be placed on probation for a specified period, during which they must maintain certain academic and disciplinary standards to avoid being dismissed again. This could include attending regular meetings with an academic advisor or completing additional coursework.\n9. Re-admission Fee: Some universities charge a re-admission fee for students who were previously dismissed and are now seeking readmission. This fee is typically non-refundable and must be paid before the student can be officially readmitted.\n10. New Application: In some cases, readmitted students may need to submit a new application to the university, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and any other required documents. They may also need to meet the current admission requirements for their program or field of study.\n\nIt is important to note that these completion requirements can vary depending on the specific policies and guidelines of Sungkyunkwan University.

However, there are some conditions and restrictions that you should be aware of:\n\n1. Eligibility: To be eligible for grade withdrawal, students must have completed the course with a grade lower than C- (or its equivalent) before going on leave. They can apply for grade withdrawal only once per course.\n2. Application period: The application period for grade withdrawal is usually during the regular registration period or within a specified time frame after the end of the semester when the student returns from leave.\n3. Approval: The approval process may vary depending on the department and the specific course requirements. Students should consult with their academic advisor or department office to understand the procedure for grade withdrawal in their program.\n4. Tuition fee: If a student applies for grade withdrawal, they will need to pay the tuition fee for the repeated course. This is because they are essentially retaking the course and it counts as an additional credit hour on their transcript.\n5. Grade replacement: Upon successful completion of the repeated course with a higher grade, the original lower grade will be replaced by the new grade in the student's academic record. However, both grades will still appear on the transcript, but only the higher grade will be considered for GPA calculation.\n6. Time limit: There may be a time limit for applying for grade withdrawal, usually within a certain number of semesters or years after completing the course. It's essential to check with your department and university guidelines for specific details.\n7. Impact on financial aid: Grade withdrawal can affect financial aid eligibility, as it may increase the total number of credits completed by the student. Students should consult with their financial aid office to understand how grade withdrawal might impact their financial aid package.\n\nIn summary, students at Sungkyunkwan University can apply for grade withdrawal while on a leave of absence, but they must meet certain eligibility requirements and follow specific application procedures.

This visa allows them to stay in Korea for the duration of their studies and engage in various activities related to their education, such as attending classes, participating in extracurricular activities, and working part-time jobs on campus.\n\nTo apply for a D-2 visa, students must first be accepted into an educational institution in Korea that is authorized by the Ministry of Education.

The application process typically involves submitting various documents, such as proof of acceptance from the educational institution, financial statements, and a passport-sized photograph.\n\nIt is important to note that the D-2 visa has specific requirements and restrictions, including the need for students to maintain a certain level of academic performance and attendance in order to renew their visas. Additionally, students may be required to undergo medical examinations and provide proof of financial ability before being granted a visa.\n\nOnce students have obtained their D-2 visa, they can enter Korea and begin their studies. However, it is important for them to be aware of the various regulations and requirements that apply to international students in Korea, such as the need to register with the immigration authorities within 90 days of arrival and the requirement to maintain a certain level of academic performance in order to renew their visas.\n\nIn summary, international students who wish to study in Korea must apply for a D-2 visa, which allows them to engage in various activities related to their education and stay in Korea for the duration of their studies.

Multiple major and maximum credits applicable: There are limitations on applying for multiple majors and the maximum number of credits applicable to a student's degree program. International students who were admitted through special admission after 2016 must submit a certificate of Korean proficiency by the end of their third semester, or they will be restricted from applying for multiple majors and maximum credits applicable (12).\n\nBy following these requirements and procedures, a student approved for re-entry at Sungkyunkwan University can successfully reinstate their status and continue with their studies.\n\n\n sources: \n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf\n../../data/pdfs\\2024 1 SKKU  international student handbook.pdf",
