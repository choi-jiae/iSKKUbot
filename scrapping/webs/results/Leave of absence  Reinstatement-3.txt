Leave of Absence (LOA)
Leave of Absence During the Regular Semesters

LOA application shall be accepted by the end of the thirteenth week of a semester if he/she has paid the tuition fee. The paid tuition fee can be refunded and the refundable amount may vary depending on the application date. The student needs to pay full tuition for reinstatement later.
A student who has their application for the tuition fee installment program accepted shall be permitted to take a leave of absence after their tuition for the entire semester is paid.
LOA requests are not allowed for freshman or transfer studentsâ€™ first semesters. However, exceptions may be approved if the reason can be certified by a legitimate medical practitioner at a 3rd tier medical institution proving that a student is unable to continue study or attend class longer than 4 weeks due to psychological, physical, or emotional discomfort or challenge.
