Plural Major Allocation

If a large number of students are focused on a specific major, the limitations on the number of students allowed are determined by the dean of the department.
When there is a limitation, the number of students allowed is allocated equally each semester. The remaining seats in the first semester are added to the second semester.
If the applicant for a size-limited department cannot meet the quota, all applicants are permitted.
If the applicant for a size-limited department exceeds the quota, applicants are assigned by the allocation ranking.
