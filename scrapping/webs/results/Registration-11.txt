How to Pay the Fees

The fees need to be paid in 4 consecutive semesters. If any remains to be paid, a student is not allowed to apply for the thesis submission qualifying examination and thesis examination/defense.
If a student wants to pay the remaining fee for research semester at once, one should apply via GLS and transfer the amount to the designated bank account.
Fees can be waived if you meet all of the graduation requirements before finishing the prescribed research semester registration.
Among students who have already paid 4 consecutive times of research semester can register additional research semester if they want to maintain the status of research student. Those who are participating in national R & D projects must register for research semester.

Procedure: GLS – Personal – tuition – Research Semester fee Payment
