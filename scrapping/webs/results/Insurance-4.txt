Health Insurance
Private(Personal) Insurance prior to Alien Registration

Since the National Health Insurance is applied only 'after the date of completion of alien registration', it is not subscribed to National Health Insurance until your alien registration is completed.
It will take around 6 to 8 weeks to apply for and receive the Alien Registration Card (ARC). It means, the subscription to National Health Insurance will be processed in 6 to 8 weeks, and it will not be covered by insurance during this period.
It is strongly recommended for all international students to subscribe in advance to a personal insurance valid for 2 to 3 months from the moment of arrival to Korea.
