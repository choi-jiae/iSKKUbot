Grading Scale Ranges and Norm-referenced Evaluation

Based on the number of students, an A Grade (A＋․A) is within 30% and the sum of the A Grades (A＋․A) and B Grades (B＋․B) is within 65%.
In general major courses, an A Grade is within 40%, and the sum of the A Grades and B Grades is within 75%.
For courses with 19 or less students, international courses, teaching practice courses, military science courses, experience practice courses, and practice courses, at the Schools of Global Leadership, Global Economics, Global Business Administration, Software, Semiconductor Systems Engineering, Global Biomedical Engineering, and major courses at the School of Medicine and School of Pharmacy, and military entrusted student courses, advanced liberal arts/fundamental courses of differentiated education, and liberal arts courses for the Schools of Global Leadership, Global Economics, Global Business Administration, Software, and Semiconductor Systems Engineering, an A Grade is within 50% and the sum of the A and B Grades is within 90%.
Graduate students, exchange students, KGSP students, and students with foreign government scholarships are all excluded from the counting of the number of students for grading and relative evaluation. Education Practice and Field Practice courses and courses with students selected by separate standards are subject to absolute evaluation.
Relative grading is based on the new field classification (core major/ general major), and not based on the old field classification (Basic Major Courses/ Advanced Major Courses). If a course is an advanced major course and core major course, relative grading will be based on the core major course.
