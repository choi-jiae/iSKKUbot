Leave of Absence (LOA)
Note

Since a student visa (D-2) will automatically be nullified in 30 days from the day of LOA, he/she needs to leave Korea before nullification of his/her visa.
If a student requests an LOA for Korean language study, he/she needs to apply for change in visa type from D-2 to D-4 within 30 days.
