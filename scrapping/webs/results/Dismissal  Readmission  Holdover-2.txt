Dismissal  Readmission  Holdover
Dismissal (Disenrollment)
Unsatisfactory Academic Performance (Undergraduate)

A student is dismissed if he/she receives 3 consecutive academic warnings or 4 academic warnings in total since the academic year of 2000, despite two holdovers.
A student joined since the academic year of 2001 is dismissed if he/she fails to achieve a GPA more than 1.00 in two consecutive semesters.
Academic warnings remain regardless of a studentâ€™s enrollment status (holdover, dismissal, and LOA) and can be continuously accumulated. However, the academic warnings that a readmitted student received during his/her first admission will be deleted.
If a readmitted student who was dismissed before due to the accumulation of academic warnings receives 3 consecutive academic warnings or 4 academic warnings in total they will be permanently dismissed.
