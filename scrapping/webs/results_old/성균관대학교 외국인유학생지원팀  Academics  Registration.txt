If a student wants to pay the remaining fee for research semester at once, one should apply via GLS and transfer the amount to the designated bank account.
Fees can be waived if you meet all of the graduation requirements before finishing the prescribed research semester registration.
Among students who have already paid 4 consecutive times of research semester can register additional research semester if they want to maintain the status of research student. Those who are participating in national R & D projects must register for research semester.

- Fee Installment, Loan, and Scholarship

The research semester registration fees are not tuition, and therefore tuition fee installment program is not available for research registration.

- Course Registration During the Research Semester

A student who has completed his/her course is not allowed to register for another course, but they can register for one class during the research semester for the preparation of their thesis.
