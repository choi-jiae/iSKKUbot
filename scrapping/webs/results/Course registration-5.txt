Additional Credit Allowance for Students with Excellent Grades (Undergraduate)

If you take more than 15 credits without failing (3rd/4th year students from the College of Confucian Studies, College of Liberal Arts, College of Social Sciences, College of Economics, and School of Business take more than 12 credits) and get a GPA of 4.00 or higher, you can take an additional 3 credits the following semester.
The additional credit allowance will automatically be provided and students can use it even after a leave of absence. If you canâ€™t find the extra 3 credits in your GLS, please contact your administrative office.
If your GPA is 4.00 or higher in the 8th semester, you need to pay the additional tuition fee for the 3 extra credits you received.
