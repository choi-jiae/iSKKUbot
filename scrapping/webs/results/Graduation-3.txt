Graduation
Undergraduate Graduation Requirements
Course Completion

When a student only fulfills credit and minimum GPA requirements but fails to pass the dissertation examination, the student is marked as ‘completed’.
A student who is in course completion status cannot acquire a bachelor’s degree, but can only print out a ‘Certificate of completion’.
If the completed student acquires the requirements for graduation within the next semester, a bachelor’s degree is given on the semester’s graduation date at the end of each academic semester.
There is no time limitation to acquire the requirements for graduation after completion.
An international undergraduate student could not stay in Korea after his graduation since his D-2 visa would be expired at the moment of completion
