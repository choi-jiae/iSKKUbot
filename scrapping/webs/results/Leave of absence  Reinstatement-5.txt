Leave of Absence (LOA)
Maternity LOA

A student can take it for one year at one time, up to 2 times in total. One of the parents with a child under 8-years-old can apply.
A student needs to submit a medical certificate or a familial relation certificate to the administrative office.
Paid tuition can be carried forward to the semester of re-entry when a registered student files for a maternity LOA during the semester, in which case no additional fee will be invoiced. A student whose application for the tuition fee installment program is accepted shall be permitted to take a leave of absence after the entire semesterâ€™s tuition fee payments are made.
